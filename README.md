# Final Project Template

KIEI-451 Winter 2021
Team: Hussain Vasi, Ramon Torres, Zach Hrabak

ID 28: The goal of this project is to create a website that will allow users to access practice problems (eg. math problems similar to GMAT), save their answers, and check to see if their answers are correct.

When a user log-ins to the website, the user will be able to select the topic and difficulty of the problem they want to tackle, and a problem will be shown on the screen for the user.

The problem database will be pre-populated/pre-defined with problems that we create and will be organized by topic and difficulty-level. Answers submitted to the problem be saved for each individual user, and will only be able to be viewed by that user.
